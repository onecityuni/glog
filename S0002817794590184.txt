Abstract: Nightguard bleaching scores high in a three-year follow-up study. In this clinical trial of nightguard vital bleaching for six weeks, 92 percent of the patients experienced some lightening of treated teeth. About 97 percent of patients with teeth stained through aging, inherent discoloration, brown fluorosis or trauma experienced lightening, as did 75 percent with tetracycline-stained teeth. Sixty-six percent experienced side effects, which resolved in 24 to 48 hours. Earliest re-treatment was done after one year in less time. Minimal color change occurred for 74 percent after 1 Â½ years and 62 percent after three years.
